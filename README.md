# PARKING LOT PROJECT

## DESCRIPTION

---

This is a parking lot project which aim is to reduce human intervention and to make it a automatic process.

In this Project I have made a parking solution for parking owner/admin.

The project can handle multi floor parking.

The parking spaces are being stored in the **Dictionary** data type storing the slot_no as key and the car info as values

The car info is again stored in the form of **Dictionay** data type having key and its value

_For eg:_

Parking Slot would be like = {'slot_no': Car_info OR Empty, 'slot_no': Car_info OR Empty, 'slot_no': Car_info OR Empty, ... So on}

Car Info would be like = {'regno': 'KA-01-HH-1234', 'color': 'White', 'current_time': '08:31:06', 'email': 'xyz@gmail.com'}

Empty/No Car would be like an empty dictionary = {}
